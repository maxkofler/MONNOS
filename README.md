# MONNOS - A little kernel

MONNOS is a hobby project, just to play around and have fun.

It is a small kernel that targets `i686` and even runs on modern computers due to their backwards compatibility.

It uses `multiboot` as the boot standard, so booting can be handled by a real bootloader like `GRUB`.
